Classification is the task of choosing the correct class label for a given input. In basic
classification tasks, each input is considered in isolation from all other inputs, and the set of labels is defined in advance. The basic classification task has a number of interesting variants. For example, in multiclass classification, each instance may be assigned multiple labels; in open-class classification, the set of labels is not defined in advance; and in sequence classification, a list of inputs are jointly classified.
